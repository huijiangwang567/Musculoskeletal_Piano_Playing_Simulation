## About the Simulation Package

This simulation package is designed for conducting neuro-musculoskeletal modeling and simulations. It is intended to be used with MATLAB R2022b and above.

The Hill-type muscle model uses the model developed by D.F.B.Haeufle, please see the following citation:

## Usage Instructions

To run simulations using this package, please follow these steps:

1. Open the `runThreeNeuron_main.m` file located in the package directory.

2. Ensure that you have MATLAB R2022b or a newer version installed on your system.

3. Modify the parameters and settings in the `runThreeNeuron_main.m` file, or in the `ArmHand.slx` as needed for your specific simulation.

4. Run the `runThreeNeuron_main.m` script in MATLAB.
